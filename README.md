## 📊 Input Parameters Explained

### Stock Ticker
- **Format**: Ticker symbol for any exchange supported by Yahoo Finance
- **Examples**: 
  - US: `MSFT`, `AAPL`, `GOOGL`, `TSLA`
  - Swiss: `NESN.SW` (Nestlé)
  - Tokyo: `7203.T` (Toyota)
  - UK: `SHEL.L` (Shell)

### Country Risk-Free Rate (%)
- **Definition**: Yield on 10-year government bond of the company's country
- **Examples**:
  - US: 4.2% (check [US Treasury](https://www.treasury.gov))
  - Switzerland: 0.8%
  - Emerging markets: 6-10%
- **Why it matters**: Base return with zero risk; foundation of cost of equity

### Country Equity Risk Premium (%)
- **Definition**: Historical premium that stocks have earned above risk-free rate
- **Standard values**:
  - US/Developed Markets: 5.0% - 6.0%
  - Emerging Markets: 7.0% - 9.0%
- **Resource**: [Damodaran's Equity Risk Premium Data](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/)
- **Why it matters**: Captures market risk premium for equity investors

### Forecast Period (Years)
- **Definition**: Number of years to explicitly forecast free cash flows
- **Recommended**:
  - Conservative: 5 years
  - Standard: 10 years
  - Aggressive/Growth: 5-7 years (with high growth assumptions)
- **Why it matters**: Balance between predictability and long-term value

### Perpetual Growth Rate (%)
- **Definition**: Long-term growth rate used in terminal value calculation
- **Best practices**:
  - Developed markets: 2.0% - 2.5% (GDP growth + inflation)
  - Emerging markets: 3.0% - 4.0%
  - **Golden Rule**: Never exceed WACC; preferably use GDP growth rate
- **Warning**: Most common DCF mistake is overstating perpetual growth
- **Why it matters**: Terminal value typically represents 60-80% of total value

### Short-Term FCFF Growth Rate (Optional)
- **Definition**: Custom annual growth rate for forecast period (overrides default 5%)
- **Use cases**:
  - High-growth companies: 10% - 20%
  - Mature/declining companies: 2% - 4%
  - If left blank: Defaults to 5%
- **Why it matters**: Critical for capturing company-specific growth trajectory

## 📈 Understanding the Visualizations

### 1. Sensitivity Analysis Heatmap
**What it shows**: How intrinsic share value changes across different WACC and perpetual growth rate assumptions

**How to read**:
- **Green cells** = Higher valuations (more optimistic scenario)
- **Red cells** = Lower valuations (more pessimistic scenario)
- **Blue box** = Your base case assumptions
- **Range** = WACC ±20%, Perpetual Growth varies with WACC constraint

**What it tells you**:
- Tight clustering around base case = Robust valuation with high confidence
- Wide spread = High sensitivity; small changes in assumptions cause large valuation swings
- Dominated by one edge = Model is driven by specific assumption; validate carefully

**Pro tip**: If your upside target is 20% but sensitivity shows range of -40% to +80%, your conviction should be low—model risk is high.

### 2. Waterfall Chart: Enterprise to Equity Value Bridge
**What it shows**: How Enterprise Value transforms to Equity Value

**Formula visualized**: `Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Total Debt + Cash`

**Components**:
1. **Enterprise Value** (starting point) - Value of business to all capital providers
2. **Less: Total Debt** (red bar downward) - Obligation to creditors
3. **Plus: Cash** (green bar upward) - Available liquid assets
4. **Equity Value** (ending point) - Value available to shareholders

**What it tells you**:
- If debt bar is huge = Company is highly leveraged; equity is riskier
- If cash bar is significant = Downside protection; equity value more stable
- Negative equity value = Company is insolvent (enterprise value < debt)

**Pro tip**: For valuation, focus on enterprise value first. Waterfall shows why equity value differs from EV due to capital structure.

### 3. DCF Components Breakdown
**What it shows**: Present value contribution of each forecast year's free cash flow plus terminal value

**Key insight**: Terminal value (final bar) typically dominates—often 60-80% of total

**What it tells you**:
- If terminal value >85% = Valuation heavily depends on perpetual growth assumption (risky)
- If fairly distributed across years = Valuation more grounded in near-term cash flows (safer)
- Negative early years = Company currently unprofitable (validate growth path)

**Pro tip**: Question your perpetual growth assumption if terminal value exceeds 80%. Consider more conservative estimates.

### 4. Price Comparison
**What it shows**: Current market price vs. your DCF intrinsic value

**Output includes**: 
- Current stock price (from Yahoo Finance)
- Intrinsic value per share (from DCF)
- Upside/downside percentage

**Color coding**:
- **Green** = Stock undervalued; intrinsic > market price
- **Red** = Stock overvalued; intrinsic < market price

**Investment implications**:
- **>20% upside** = Potentially significant buying opportunity
- **10-20% upside** = Moderate buying opportunity
- **-10% to +10%** = Fairly valued
- **<-20% downside** = Potentially overvalued

**Pro tip**: Don't trade solely on DCF signals. Use as one input alongside technical analysis, sentiment, and catalysts.

### 5. WACC Breakdown
**What it shows**: Pie chart of how cost of equity and cost of debt contribute to total WACC

**Interpretation**:
- **Cost of Equity weight** = % financed by equity; reflects shareholder cost
- **Cost of Debt weight** = % financed by debt; reflects creditor cost (lower due to tax shield)

**What it tells you**:
- Equity-heavy (90%+) = Lower leverage but higher cost of capital
- Balanced capital structure (40-60% debt) = Optimal WACC for most companies
- Highly leveraged (70%+ debt) = Financial risk increases significantly

**Pro tip**: Companies with low WACC (5-7%) have competitive advantages; companies with high WACC (12%+) face steep hurdle rates.

### 6. Cash Flow Forecast
**What it shows**: Projected FCFF growth over your forecast period

**Elements**:
- **Blue line** = Forecasted free cash flows year-by-year
- **Orange dashed line** = Base year FCFF (for comparison)
- **Data labels** = Exact values at each point

**What it tells you**:
- Steep upward slope = Aggressive growth assumptions
- Flat trajectory = Mature company assumptions
- Negative values = Currently unprofitable (validate turnaround case)

**Pro tip**: Compare this trajectory to company's historical FCFF growth. If forecast assumes 15% growth but historical is 3%, justify the inflection point.

## 🔍 Key Formulas & Calculations

### Cost of Equity (CAPM)
```
Cost of Equity = Risk-Free Rate + (Beta × Equity Risk Premium)
```

### Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)
```
WACC = (E/V × Cost of Equity) + (D/V × Cost of Debt × (1 - Tax Rate))

Where:
E = Market value of equity
V = Total firm value (E + D)
D = Market value of debt
```

### Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF)
```
FCFF = EBIT × (1 - Tax Rate) + Depreciation - CapEx - Change in Working Capital
```

### Terminal Value (Perpetuity Growth Model)
```
Terminal Value = FCFF_Final × (1 + Perpetual Growth Rate) / (WACC - Perpetual Growth Rate)
```

### Enterprise Value (DCF)
```
EV = Σ [FCFF_Year_t / (1 + WACC)^t] + [Terminal Value / (1 + WACC)^n]

Where:
t = Year 1 to n (forecast period)
n = Final year of forecast
```

### Equity Value
```
Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Total Debt + Cash
```

### Intrinsic Value Per Share
```
Share Price = Equity Value / Shares Outstanding
```

## ⚠️ Important Caveats & Best Practices

### DCF Limitations
- **Garbage in, garbage out**: Model quality depends entirely on input assumptions
- **Terminal value dominance**: Often 60-80% of value; small growth rate changes cause massive swings
- **Point estimate, not a range**: The final number is ONE scenario, not a prediction
- **Past performance ≠ future results**: Historical metrics don't guarantee future FCFF growth

### How to Use Responsibly
1. **Run sensitivity analysis**: The heatmap is more valuable than any single number
2. **Cross-validate with multiples**: Compare DCF result to EV/EBITDA, P/E, P/B multiples
3. **Document assumptions**: Keep a record of inputs and reasoning for future reference
4. **Update regularly**: Rerun quarterly after earnings; assumptions change
5. **Use for ranking, not precision**: Better for "which stock is cheapest?" than "exact value is $47.32"

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- ❌ Using perpetual growth >3% for mature companies
- ❌ Ignoring terminal value sensitivity; not testing assumptions
- ❌ Forgetting to update inputs with new financial data
- ❌ Using DCF as sole investment criterion
- ❌ Overstating near-term growth (forecast period growth should be conservative)

### Validation Checklist
- [ ] Risk-free rate reflects actual government bond yields
- [ ] Equity risk premium aligns with published research (Damodaran, Ibbotson)
- [ ] Perpetual growth ≤ WACC (otherwise model breaks)
- [ ] FCFF forecast growth is justified by company fundamentals
- [ ] Beta is reasonable for industry (compare to peers)
- [ ] Tax rate is consistent with company's recent history
- [ ] Terminal value as % of EV seems reasonable (ideally 50-75%)

## 🛠️ Customization & Advanced Usage

### Modifying FCFF Growth
Edit the `forecast_fcff()` function for custom growth logic:

```python
def forecast_fcff(base_fcff: float, forecast_years: int, short_term_growth: Optional[float] = None) -> list:
    # Current: Linear growth rate
    # Modify: Add declining growth rate, step-function, or company-specific logic
```

### Changing Visualization Style
Customize colors and styling in `create_visualizations()`:

```python
# Edit color palettes
colors = ['#4A90E2', '#E24A4A', ...]  # Change hex codes for your branding

# Adjust figure size
plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (14, 10)  # Default is 20x12
```

### Batch Analysis
Create a wrapper to run DCF on multiple tickers:

```python
import subprocess
import json

tickers = ['MSFT', 'AAPL', 'GOOGL']
assumptions = {
    'risk_free_rate': 4.2,
    'equity_risk_premium': 5.5,
    'forecast_years': 5,
    'perpetual_growth': 2.5
}

# Automate inputs
for ticker in tickers:
    result = subprocess.run(['python', 'dcf_viz.py'], 
                          input=f"{ticker}\n4.2\n5.5\n5\n2.5\n", 
                          text=True)
```

### Adding New Calculations
Extend the script with additional metrics:

```python
def calculate_fcff_margin(fcff: float, revenue: float) -> float:
    return fcff / revenue

def calculate_fcf_yield(fcff: float, market_cap: float) -> float:
    return fcff / market_cap
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "WACC must be greater than perpetual growth rate"
**Cause**: Perpetual growth rate ≥ WACC; model mathematically invalid
**Solution**: 
- Lower perpetual growth rate (try 2% for developed markets)
- Increase risk-free rate or ERP
- Increase company beta
- Check tax rate (may be too low, inflating WACC)

### Issue: "Could not fetch financials for [TICKER]"
**Cause**: Ticker invalid or company doesn't report to SEC
**Solution**:
- Verify ticker format (add exchange suffix if needed: `NESN.SW`)
- Check if company is public and reports financials
- Try alternative ticker format
- For international stocks, ensure Yahoo Finance coverage

### Issue: "Beta not available"
**Cause**: Yahoo Finance doesn't have beta for this security
**Solution**: Script defaults to beta = 1.0 (market risk). Consider:
- Manually overriding in code with industry average
- Using [Damodaran's industry betas](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/Betas.html)
- Calculating historical beta from returns

### Issue: Terminal Value is negative
**Cause**: WACC too close to perpetual growth rate
**Solution**: See solution to first issue above

### Issue: Visualizations not displaying / saving
**Cause**: matplotlib backend issue
**Solution**:
```bash
# Force backend in script or terminal
export MPLBACKEND=Agg
python dcf_viz.py

# Or modify script:
import matplotlib
matplotlib.use('Agg')
```
